# Aegis-Orchestrator Phase 2 Summary

## Overview

Phase 2 of Aegis-Orchestrator adds advanced monitoring, detection, and alerting capabilities to the core orchestration engine. These features enable more robust service health monitoring, early problem detection, and automated response to service issues.

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Advanced Health Checking

- **gRPC Health Checker**: Added support for monitoring gRPC services using the standard gRPC health checking protocol.
- **Script Health Checker**: Implemented custom script-based health checks for complex scenarios.
- **Enhanced Retry Policies**: Added exponential backoff with jitter for more robust health checking.

### 2. Log Analysis

- **Pattern-Based Log Analysis**: Implemented regex-based log pattern matching to detect errors in service logs.
- **Configurable Log Monitoring**: Added support for monitoring multiple log files with different patterns.
- **Severity Levels**: Implemented different severity levels for log patterns (CRITICAL, WARNING, INFO).

### 3. Anomaly Detection

- **Latency Monitoring**: Added detection of abnormal service response times.
- **Throughput Monitoring**: Implemented monitoring of service request throughput.
- **Error Rate Monitoring**: Added detection of abnormal error rates.
- **Configurable Thresholds**: Implemented service-specific thresholds for each metric.

### 4. Prometheus Integration

- **Enhanced Metrics**: Added more detailed metrics for service health and performance.
- **Service Uptime Tracking**: Implemented tracking of service uptime.
- **Health Check Metrics**: Added metrics for health check duration and results.
- **Restart Metrics**: Added tracking of service restart counts.

### 5. Alerting

- **Threshold-Based Alerting**: Implemented alerts based on configurable thresholds.
- **Alert State Management**: Added management of alert states (firing, resolved).
- **Webhook Notifications**: Implemented webhook-based notifications for integration with external systems.
- **Alert Severity Levels**: Added different severity levels for alerts (CRITICAL, WARNING, INFO).

## Implementation Details

### Configuration Changes

Extended the YAML configuration to support new features:

```yaml
logs:
  enabled: true
  scan_interval: "1m"
  files:
    - service: "example-service"
      path: "/path/to/example-service.log"
  patterns:
    - name: "OutOfMemory"
      pattern: "(?i)(out of memory|java\\.lang\\.OutOfMemoryError)"
      severity: "CRITICAL"
      description: "Out of memory error detected"
      
anomaly_detection:
  enabled: true
  detection_interval: "30s"
  history_size: 100
  thresholds:
    latency:
      - service: "example-service"
        value: 500  # milliseconds
    error_rate:
      - service: "example-service"
        value: 0.05  # 5%
    throughput:
      - service: "example-service"
        value: 10  # requests/second
```

### Code Structure

- **monitor/log_analyzer.go**: Implements log analysis functionality
- **monitor/anomaly.go**: Implements anomaly detection
- **monitor/alerting.go**: Implements alerting system
- **monitor/prometheus.go**: Implements Prometheus metrics
- **health/grpc.go**: Implements gRPC health checker
- **health/script.go**: Implements script health checker
- **health/retry.go**: Implements enhanced retry policies

### Testing

Created example services and tools for testing:

- **examples/http-service**: Simple HTTP service for testing health checks
- **examples/webhook-server**: Server for receiving alert notifications
- **scripts/test-phase2.ps1**: Script for testing Phase 2 features
- **run-phase2-demo.ps1**: Script for running a complete demo of Phase 2 features

## Future Enhancements

Potential enhancements for future phases:

1. **Distributed Coordination**: Add support for coordinating multiple Aegis instances
2. **Service Discovery**: Implement automatic service discovery
3. **Advanced Deployment**: Add support for blue/green deployments and canary releases
4. **User Interface**: Develop a web-based UI for monitoring and management
5. **Machine Learning**: Implement ML-based anomaly detection for more accurate predictions
